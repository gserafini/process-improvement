Use the process-improvement-protocol skill to systematically analyze and fix workflow frustrations.

**Usage:** `/improve [week|month|year|all]`

**Time frames:**
- `/improve` or `/improve month` - Analyze last 30 days (default)
- `/improve week` - Analyze last 7 days (recent issues only)
- `/improve year` - Analyze last 365 days (long-term patterns)
- `/improve all` - Analyze entire history (all time)

**What this does:**
1. Saves your current context (for resume later)
2. Analyzes root causes using historical data (within time frame)
3. Proposes evidence-based fixes
4. Implements fixes immediately (with your approval)
5. Tracks effectiveness over time

**When to use:**
- You're frustrated with repeated agent failures
- Agent keeps making the same mistake
- You want systematic improvement, not apologies

**Invokes:** Skill(process-improvement:process-improvement-protocol)
