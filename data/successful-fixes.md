# Successful Fixes

**Purpose**: Track what actually works, sorted by effectiveness

**Format**: Each fix includes:
- Fix name and date implemented
- Problem it solved
- Effectiveness rating (solved, highly_effective, moderately_effective, etc.)
- Where it's implemented (file paths)
- Evidence of success (before/after metrics)

---

## Highly Effective Fixes (>80% reduction)

_None yet - waiting for first successful intervention_

---

## Moderately Effective Fixes (50-80% reduction)

_None yet_

---

## Minimally Effective Fixes (20-50% reduction)

_These may need refinement or replacement_

---

## Ineffective Fixes (<20% reduction)

_These should be removed or completely rethought_

---

## Solved Patterns (0 recurrences in 2+ weeks)

_The ultimate success - problems that no longer occur_
