# Experiments Log

**Purpose**: Track what we tried, whether it worked, and what we learned

**Format**: Each experiment includes:
- Date started
- Hypothesis (what we thought would fix the problem)
- Implementation (what we actually did)
- Results (did it work?)
- Learnings (what did we discover?)
